Thanks for stopping by!

KonfDB, designed and developed by Punit Ganshani, is a complete open-source solution to configuration management for multi-tenant applications hosted on any platform.  You can now get rid of your XML and JSON configuration files and get onboarded to KonfDB where you can access and change your application configuration from almost anywhere with no effort.

KonfDB uses an efficient data model that can be modelled and used as per your application needs.  Be it an enterprise application or your hobby application, you can now use KonfDB data model and APIs to access tenant-specific configuration with no effort.  So development teams can now focus on the core development without having to worry about some of the aspects such as proprietory configuration file formats, horrors of maintaining multiple XML or JSON files, inability to change configuration without re-deployments and alike.
